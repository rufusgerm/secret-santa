# secret-santa

A secret santa app for the holidays to practice skills and learn a couple new ones.
I don't have a good name for it, so that's what it'll be, I guess. Keeping it ugly to
start to just get something working (current deadline for the most basic functionality
is Thanksgiving 2021). I will pretty it up later!

Written with TypeScript in Next.js
Using Prisma as an ORM backed by MySQL

Likely implementations:

- ~~iron-session for: Magic Link auth~~ :white_check_mark:
- ~~tailwind-css for: aiding my gawdawful UI design sensibilities; it helped, but there's only so much it can do~~ :white_check_mark:
- ~~Postmark for: sending transactional emails for logins and invites~~ :white_check_mark:
- cuid for: smaller, unique URL slugs
- pino/logflare for: ...well, logging
